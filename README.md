Windows Defender Remover:  
There is a more detail readme in the zip. Just run the batch file and it will completely remove windows security from any version.
This is permanent so grab a snapshot before doing this so you can easily revert.  Enjoy!

Zero-Day:
This was a zero day called Hoaxshell. Still a good emulator to test security! It is an all-in-one
C2 server that automatically encodes a base64 powershell that remote shells completely undetected.
